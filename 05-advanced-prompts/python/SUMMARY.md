# Code Summary

## aoai-assignment.py

**File: main.py**

- **Description**: This script creates a simple Flask web application that greets users by name. If no name is provided in the URL, it defaults to greeting "World".
- **High-Level Overview**:
    - **External Libraries**:
        - `flask`: Used to create the web application.
    - **Control Flow**:
        - The script initializes a Flask application instance.
        - It defines a route `/` that, when accessed, retrieves the 'name' parameter from the URL.
        - The `hello()` function is called when the root URL is accessed.
        - The application runs in debug mode if the script is executed directly.
    - **Functions**:
        - `hello()`: Retrieves the 'name' argument from the request, defaulting to 'World' if the argument is not provided. It then returns a greeting string.
    - **Error Handling**:
        - No explicit error handling is present. Flask's default error handling will apply.
    - **File System Operations**:
        - No file system operations are performed.
    - **User Instructions**:
        - To run the application, execute the script.
        - Access the application in a web browser by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
        - To greet a specific name, add `?name=YourName` to the URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/?name=Alice`).

## aoai-solution.py

**File: main.py**

- **Description**: This Flask application defines a simple web form to collect a user's name and email, validates the input, and displays a greeting message. It also includes basic error handling for bad requests.
- **High-Level Overview**:
    - **External Libraries**:
        - `flask`: Used for creating the web application and handling HTTP requests.
        - `flask_wtf`: Used for creating and validating web forms.
        - `wtforms`: Used for defining form fields and validators.
    - **Control Flow**:
        - The application starts by creating a Flask app instance.
        - A `HelloForm` class is defined using `FlaskForm` to represent the form with fields for name and email, including validation rules.
        - The `/` route is defined to handle both GET and POST requests.
        - When a POST request is submitted, the form is validated. If valid, the name and email are extracted and displayed in a greeting message.
        - If the form is not valid or a GET request is made, the form is rendered.
        - An error handler is defined for HTTP 400 errors (Bad Request).
        - The application runs in debug mode when the script is executed directly.
    - **Functions**:
        - `hello()`: Handles requests to the root route (`/`). It creates an instance of `HelloForm`, validates it on submission, and renders the form or displays a greeting message.
        - `bad_request(error)`: Handles HTTP 400 errors and returns a simple error message.
    - **Classes**:
        - `HelloForm(FlaskForm)`: Defines the structure and validation rules for the web form. It includes fields for name (validated for data presence and minimum length) and email (validated for data presence and email format).
    - **Error Handling**:
        - The `@app.errorhandler(400)` decorator registers the `bad_request` function to handle HTTP 400 errors.
    - **File System Operations**:
        - The script does not directly interact with the file system.
    - **User Instructions**:
        - To run the application, save the code as `main.py` and execute it using `python main.py`.
        - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the form.
        - Fill in the form with your name and email and submit it.
        - If the form is valid, you will see a greeting message. If not, you will see validation errors.
